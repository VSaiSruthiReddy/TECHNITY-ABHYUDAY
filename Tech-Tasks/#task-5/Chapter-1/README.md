CHAPTER 1: - <br />
<br />
•	Operators: *, -, /, + Values: 'hello', -88.8, 5 
•	Variable: spam String: 'spam'
•	Three data types: Integer, Float, String
•	An expression is made up of operators and values that can be evaluated to produce a result. All expressions return a value.
•	An expression produces a value when evaluated, whereas a statement performs an action. Assignment statements like "spam = 10" are statements.
•	After running the code: bacon = 20 bacon + 1 The variable "bacon" still contains 20.
•	'spam' + 'spamspam' evaluates to 'spamspamspam' 'spam' * 3 evaluates to 'spamspamspam'
•	Variable names must start with a letter. 100 starts with a digit.
•	int(), float(), str()
•	The error is due to trying to concatenate a string ('I have eaten ') with an integer (99). You can fix it by converting 99 to a string: 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
