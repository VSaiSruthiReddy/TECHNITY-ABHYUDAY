CHAPTER 1: - <br />
<br />
•	Operators: *, -, /, + Values: 'hello', -88.8, 5 <br />
•	Variable: spam String: 'spam' <br />
•	Three data types: Integer, Float, String <br />
•	An expression is made up of operators and values that can be evaluated to produce a result. All expressions return a value. <br />
•	An expression produces a value when evaluated, whereas a statement performs an action. Assignment statements like "spam = 10" are statements. <br />
•	After running the code: bacon = 20 bacon + 1 The variable "bacon" still contains 20. <br />
•	'spam' + 'spamspam' evaluates to 'spamspamspam' 'spam' * 3 evaluates to 'spamspamspam' <br />
•	Variable names must start with a letter. 100 starts with a digit. <br />
•	int(), float(), str()  <br />
•	The error is due to trying to concatenate a string ('I have eaten ') with an integer (99). You can fix it by converting 99 to a string: 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.' <br />
