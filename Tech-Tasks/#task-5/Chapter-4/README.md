CHAPTER 4:- <br />
<br />
•	[] represents an empty list in Python. <br />
•	To assign 'hello' as the third value in the list stored in the variable spam: <br />
•	spam[2] = 'hello' <br />
•	spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluates to 'd'. <br />
•	spam[-1] evaluates to 'd'. <br />
•	spam[:2] evaluates to ['a', 'b']. <br />
•	bacon.index('cat') evaluates to 1. <br />
•	After bacon.append(99), the list value in bacon becomes [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]. <br />
•	After bacon.remove('cat'), the list value in bacon becomes [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]. <br />
•	List concatenation operator: + List replication operator: * <br />
•	The append() method adds a value to the end of the list. The insert() method inserts a value at a specific index in the list. <br />
•	Two ways to remove values from a list are using the remove() method and the del statement. <br />
•	Both list values and string values can be indexed and sliced. They can also be looped over using loops like for. <br />
•	Lists are mutable (can be modified), while tuples are immutable (cannot be modified). <br />
•	Tuple containing the integer value 42: (42,) <br />
•	To get the tuple form of a list value: tuple(some_list) To get the list form of a tuple value: list(some_tuple) <br />
•	Variables that "contain" list values store references (pointers) to the memory location where the list data is stored. <br />
•	copy.copy() performs a shallow copy of a list, meaning it creates a new list, but the elements within it may still refer to the same objects as the original list.  copy.deepcopy() performs a deep copy, creating entirely new objects for the copied list, including all nested objects. <br />
