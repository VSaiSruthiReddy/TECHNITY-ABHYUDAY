5)  Six comparison operators: == (equal), != (not equal), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to). <br />
6) Equal to operator (==) compares values for equality, while the assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable. <br />

11) break is used to exit a loop completely, while continue is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. <br />
12) range(10) generates numbers from 0 to 9. All three forms are equivalent. <br />
